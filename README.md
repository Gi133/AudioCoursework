Audio Coursework Project using DirectAudio

# What is it?
This is an application that relies entirely on sound to convey location. 
The idea was that someone could potentially play a game like this without the need of visual aid simply by using hearing.

This is done by setting up a monster that makes frequent sounds as well as constant broken record sound looped and positioned on a certain spot in the world.
The player must avoid the monster, the rythm of the players heartbeat along with the volume of the monster will help the player judge how close the monster is to their position.
Another trick the player has is that they can rotate themselves in order to more accurately judge where the monster is in relation to their current position.

# How do I run this?
Make sure you have directx sdk installed, download and build. You should be greeted with a window showing the game controls as well as the, hopefully, scary sound of a monster coming to get you.
